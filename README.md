Github Repo for Corpus Phallosum, a puzzling installation by August Luhrs and David Fulmer

Haven't gotten a chance to write up a detailed guide on how to actually use this repo if you want to make something similar, might have to dig around, sorry! The final sketch as of 6/25/18 is august/musickeyripple.pde 

Feel free to email me at augustluhrs(at)gmail with any questions!
